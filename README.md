## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This work introduces a **data-driven framework** for optimizing NEXI (Neurite Exchange Imaging) protocols using **explainable machine learning** (XAI) to reduce scan time without compromising accuracy.

We propose and validate two complementary strategies:

- âœ… **SHAP-RFE optimization** using XGBoost regression, recursive feature elimination, and SHAP values.
- âœ… **FIM-based optimization** using the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (D-optimality) for protocol reduction.

From an initial 15-feature ($b$, $\Delta$) protocol, we derived an optimal 8-feature subset. This reduced protocol cuts scan time by nearly **50%**, while retaining estimation accuracy, anatomical contrast, and test-retest reliability across all NEXI parameters ($t_{ex}$, $f$, $D_i$, $D_e$).

## ðŸ“ˆ Output visualizations

Both optimization pipelines generate summary visualizations showing the retained features (acquisition points) and their ranking.

| XAI / SHAP-RFE (data-driven)                          | FIM (theory-driven)                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Produced by: `xai_optimization.py`              | Produced by: `fim_optimization.py`            |
| ![SHAP](./C2_complex_xgb_optimization.png)       | ![FIM](./C2_complex_fim_optimization.png)      |

These images show the selected ($b$, $\Delta$) points (green circles) ranked by importance. The SHAP-based optimization integrates fitting performance and noise robustness, while the FIM method uses D-optimality to assess theoretical identifiability.
